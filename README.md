# Function-Approximation-by-Neural-Networks---1D


This repository contains 2 folders : the first one using neural networks from scratch and the second one using Keras.
In each of them, the files with the name 'Discretization' and 'Discretization_2' contains approximation functions by neural networks, where the mesh is divided in sub-intervals.
Also, in 'Discretization'-type files, one has weights that are initialized independently on each sub-interval,
while in 'Discretization_2'-type files, the weights are reused after the neural network training on the previous sub-interval.
